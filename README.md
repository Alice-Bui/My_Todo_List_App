# My Todo List

My Todo List is a project created as part of Assignment 1 for course 3701ICT Mobile Application Development, focusing on developing an interactive mobile application for personal task manager. This project is implemented using React Native – a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework for natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The software would provide users with a convenient mobile tool in organizing and managing their daily tasks and responsibilities effectively, thus maintaining a productive personal lifestyle. 


The key functionalities of this app are as follows:

•	Adding new tasks to the user’s todo list 

•	Allowing modification for users to edit their existing tasks

•	Enabling users to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed


To carry out the project efficiently within a short amount of development times and monitor the progress thoroughly, the project will be devided into three phases as below:

•	Milestone 1: Main Page Display

•	Milestone 2: Enhancing Functionality and Navigation

•	Milestone 3 (Final): Complete the My Todo List App with enhancement in the user interface
